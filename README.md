# 1966 Showman

Documents relating to the restoration of a 1966 Fender Showman amplifier. 
PDFs, Schmatics, Layouts, etc all copywright to their respective owners.

The most interesting bit here is the SVG recreation of the original Showman tube chart.

All the files are in an envelope in the bottom of the restored amp cabinet.
